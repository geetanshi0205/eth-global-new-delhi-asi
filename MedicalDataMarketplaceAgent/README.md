## Database Schema

- `title`: Report title
- `description`: Report description
- `report_type`: Type of medical report
- `price_eth`: Price in ETH (e.g., 0.001)
- `seller_wallet`: Wallet address to receive payment
- `anonymized_content`: HIPAA-compliant anonymized medical data
- `tags`: Searchable tags
- `test_date`: Original test date
- `published_at`: Publication timestamp

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

RECIPIENT_WALLET=your_wallet_address

# LLM for anonymization
ASI1_API_KEY=your_asi_api_key
```
